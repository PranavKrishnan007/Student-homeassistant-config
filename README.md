# Make a Student Home 🏠 -> Smart 💡

You will probably think, what is Home Assistant!? Well Home Assistant is a home automation platform running on Python 3. It is able to track and control all devices at home and offer a platform for automating control.

## Story

During student life there is often that one step that you will live on your own, I recently took that step but with an important goal. You could almost say *"I am a man with a mission"*, because I want to make the 25m2 that I have a **super smart house**.

You can follow my entire adventure via **[student-techlife.com][techlife]**

This is by the way not my first [Home Assistant][home-assistant] configuration that you find on Github, also take a look at [this repository][smarthome] with a much larger configuration.

Be free to use the code from this repo for your own Home Assistant environment, keep in mind that you can not always copy everything line by line. If you can not get out, you can always contact me.
